6.  stdint.h is a library with int(s) of predefined sized, which are used in
    bmp.h, where we declare structures with such predefined int(s)
7.  Because these int(s) have predefined size so we may store it in the
    structure and accurately stream through the BMP files, pointing to right
    properties of the BMP file.
8.  BYTE = 1 byte; DWORD = 4 bytes; LING = 4 bytes; WORD = 2 bytes.
9.  The header field used to identify the BMP and DIB file is 0x42 0x4D in
    hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII.
10. bfSize represents the size of the BMP file in bytes. biSize represents
    size of the raw bitmap data (including padding).
11. Negative biHeight means that image is mirrored upside down.
12. biBitCount.
13. Because search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix,
    or the file exists and the permissions specified by mode are denied, or
    the file does not exist and write permission is denied for the parent
    directory of the file to be created.
14. Because it says that we want to read only one element of size of the
    previous argument.

16. fseek "moves the stream" of output file to skip a padding which is added in
    the following block of code.
17. SEEK_CUR is a third argument of fseek function which tells the stream to
    shift a number in second argument from current position.
